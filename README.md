# ORRG - Open and Reproducible Research Group

We are a collaborative group based at the [Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science, TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/isds/home/) and at [Know-Center GmbH](https://www.know-center.at/). Combining competences in information science, sociology, and psychology, we conduct meta-research to investigate and assess services, policies, and practices that make research more open, responsible and reproducible.
