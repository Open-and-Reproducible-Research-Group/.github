We are a collaborative group based at the [Institute of Interactive Systems and Data Science, TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/isds/home/) and at [Know-Center GmbH](https://www.know-center.at/). Combining competences in information science, sociology, and psychology, we conduct meta-research to investigate and assess services, policies, and practices that make research more open, responsible and reproducible.

As a group, we are dedicated to practicing transparent, participatory and inclusive research. We have therefore set principles for ourselves we are committed to uphold. These can be found in our [Open Science and Research Integrity Policy](https://orrg.eu/conduct/).
